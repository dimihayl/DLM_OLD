I have added the possibility to make a cut on the total momentum of the pairs. The cut can be applied after loading the data.

-The potentials are now saved as an array of functions (ShortRangePotential). I have changed the "polarization" therminology with "channels". 
-The user can now have multiple channels (e.g. related to the spin) and for each of them all partial-wave potentials need to be defined!
-The potential itself should be defined as f(double* par)

-I made the code much more robust against division by zero. This fixed a bug resulting in 'nan' states of C(k) in some rare cases.

13.07.2017, CATS 1.2
-there was a major flaw in the way the folding was performed under the assuption that the angle theta should be taken into account.
 This issue has been now correctly implemented.
-I have added some new Get-function in CATS (to access the info about the data-source)
