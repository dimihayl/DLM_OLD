I have added the possibility to make a cut on the total momentum of the pairs. The cut can be applied after loading the data.

-The potentials are now saved as an array of functions (ShortRangePotential). I have changed the "polarization" therminology with "channels". 
-The user can now have multiple channels (e.g. related to the spin) and for each of them all partial-wave potentials need to be defined!
-The potential itself should be defined as f(double* par)
