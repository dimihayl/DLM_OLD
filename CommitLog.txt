I have added the possibility to make a cut on the total momentum of the pairs. The cut can be applied after loading the data.

-The potentials are now saved as an array of functions (ShortRangePotential). I have changed the "polarization" therminology with "channels". 
-The user can now have multiple channels (e.g. related to the spin) and for each of them all partial-wave potentials need to be defined!
-The potential itself should be defined as f(double* par)

-I made the code much more robust against division by zero. This fixed a bug resulting in 'nan' states of C(k) in some rare cases.

-there was a major flaw in the way the folding was performed under the assuption that the angle theta should be taken into account.
 This issue has been now correctly implemented.
-I have added some new Get-function in CATS (to access the info about the data-source)

this is a huge commit, since there was the need to change the computing grid.
There is an intermediate version 1.3 that was never commited due to some problems with it.
In the end version 1.4 should be something as a beta-version to a planned version 2.0.
The new computing grid in 1.4 works as follows:
for each k,b bin one looks at the source functions and creates a source-grid. The source-grid 
is practically a tree, which is divided into segments until the value of the source function 
reaches some minimal value. This allows to create as few grid-bins as possible and save memory and computing time.
HOWEVER: there is one big issue that needs to be taken care of in 2.0 :
a single k,b bins has on average quite few entries, which leads to issues when subdividing the grid, 
e.g. we never actually reach the desired low-limit and form a lot of zero-valued grid bins. In addition, if we have a lot of 
b-bins computing time will be quite large. The idea for 2.0 is to to make the grid the same for all b-bins based on all particle 
pairs regardless of their b-value. Then evaluate the wave-function for each grid-bin and save this value. Such a procedure will 
make sure that we do not re-evaluate the wave-function for each b-bin!
